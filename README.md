# Ducklings

## About

This program creates a scrolling field of ducklings. Each duckling has slight 
variations: they can face left or right and have two different body sizes, four 
types of eyes, two types of mouths, and three positions for their wings. This 
gives us 96 different possible variations, which the Ducklings program produces endlessly.
